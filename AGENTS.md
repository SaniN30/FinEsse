# FinEsse

Next.js 14+ (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 + Framer Motion.

- Design system (fonts, palette, spacing, motion conventions): see `DESIGN.md` at
  repo root — read it before adding any new UI so later phases stay visually
  consistent.
- Reusable primitives live in `components/` (`Button`, `LevelCard`, `ProgressBar`,
  `Nav`, `Hero`, `LevelSection`, `PocketMoneyPlanner`, `TierPlaceholder`) and
  `components/auth/` (`AuthCard`, `FormField`, `PinInput`) — prefer extending these
  over ad-hoc styling.
- Routes: `/` (landing), `/school`, `/college`, `/job-ready` (tier placeholders,
  content lands in later phases), plus the Phase 6 auth flow below.
- Tailwind v4 theme tokens are defined as CSS variables in `app/globals.css` under
  `@theme inline` (no `tailwind.config` color overrides needed).
- Backend (Phase 1-5): Supabase schema, RLS, auth/consent flow, the ledger/mastery-graph
  model, the School-tier lesson/quiz content schema + auto-grading RPC, the College-tier
  content (roles reference table, modeling exercises + rubric-graded submissions), and the
  Phase 5 AI Interview Coach (question bank, submission RPC, Gemini-based rubric-scoring
  Edge Function) are documented in `BACKEND.md` — read it before touching `supabase/` or
  writing any frontend code that talks to the backend. Phase 5 has no audio/speech-to-text
  pipeline (transcript is plain text input).

## Auth / consent frontend (Phase 6)

- Supabase browser client: `lib/supabase/client.ts` (exports the `supabase` singleton
  and a `getSupabaseClient()` accessor for the same instance), reading
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` from `.env.local`
  (gitignored — populate from your own Supabase project credentials, never commit
  them). Session state lives in `lib/supabase/auth-context.tsx`
  (`AuthProvider`/`useAuth`), mounted once in `app/layout.tsx` — this is the only
  auth context; don't create a parallel one.
- Routes: `/signup`, `/login` (parent), `/consent`, `/create-student`,
  `/student-login`, `/dashboard` — implements Flow A from
  `data/finesse-uiux-planning/report.md` §3. There is deliberately no
  independent student sign-up route; a student account can only be created by
  an authenticated parent via `/consent` → `/create-student`.
- The live Supabase project has email confirmation enabled (`mailer_autoconfirm:
  false`), so `signUp()` often returns no session — `/signup` shows a "confirm
  your email" state in that case, and `/login` + `ensureParentProfile()`
  (`lib/supabase/auth-actions.ts`) create the `profiles` row on first
  post-confirmation login instead.
- The backend has no lookup from a student's display name to their synthetic
  login email (`profiles` RLS blocks anonymous reads by design), so
  `/student-login` can only list students this browser has already created —
  see the caching note in `lib/supabase/student-registry.ts`. This is a known
  frontend-only workaround, not a backend contract.
- Component tests for this flow live in `tests/component/` (vitest + jsdom +
  React Testing Library, run via `npm run test:component`) — separate from the
  `tests/integration/` suite (vitest against the live/local Supabase project,
  run via `npm run test:integration`), which already covers the backend
  consent gate end-to-end.

## School lesson→quiz→XP loop and Pocket Money Planner (Phase 7)

- Mastery/XP/balances are always fetched live from the `skill_mastery`/`xp_events`/
  `account_balances`/`savings_goal_progress` views per `BACKEND.md`'s "derive on read"
  principle — never cache a computed level/balance client-side. School lesson→quiz→XP UI
  lives under `app/school/` + `components/school/`; the Pocket Money Planner lives in
  `components/PocketMoneyPlanner.tsx` + `components/pocket-money/`.
- Its component tests live alongside Phase 6's in `tests/components/` (plural — a second
  spec directory covered by the same `vitest.config.component.ts` and
  `npm run test:component`), with its own `tests/components/setup.ts` adding an
  `IntersectionObserver` mock for framer-motion's `whileInView`.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file short and durable — project structure, conventions, and
non-obvious constraints that apply to nearly every session. Point to
authoritative files (like `DESIGN.md`) instead of duplicating their content.
Update it when the project's structure or conventions materially change, not
for routine feature work.
