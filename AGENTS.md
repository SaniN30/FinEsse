# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

# FinEsse

Next.js 14+ (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 + Framer Motion. Phase 0
scaffold: design system + landing page only, no backend/Supabase wiring yet.

- Design system (fonts, palette, spacing, motion conventions): see `DESIGN.md` at
  repo root — read it before adding any new UI so later phases stay visually
  consistent.
- Reusable primitives live in `components/` (`Button`, `LevelCard`, `ProgressBar`,
  `Nav`, `Hero`, `LevelSection`, `PocketMoneyPlanner`, `TierPlaceholder`) — prefer
  extending these over ad-hoc styling.
- Routes: `/` (landing), `/school`, `/college`, `/job-ready` (tier placeholders,
  content lands in later phases).
- Tailwind v4 theme tokens are defined as CSS variables in `app/globals.css` under
  `@theme inline` (no `tailwind.config` color overrides needed).

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file short and durable — project structure, conventions, and
non-obvious constraints that apply to nearly every session. Point to
authoritative files (like `DESIGN.md`) instead of duplicating their content.
Update it when the project's structure or conventions materially change, not
for routine feature work.
